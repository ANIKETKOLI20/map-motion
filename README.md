## Project Overview
This web application displays a vehicle moving on a map in real-time. It uses the Google Maps API to render the map and track the vehicle's location and movement along a specified route. The application also provides a backend API to supply vehicle location and route data.

## Features
Real-time vehicle tracking on a map.
Visualization of the vehicle's path.
Backend API for serving vehicle location data.

## Technologies Used
Frontend: HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Google Maps API (or alternative mapping library).
Backend: Node.js, Express.
Database: Not used in this implementation (uses dummy data in JSON file).

## Usage
Start the Backend Server: Run npm start to start the server and serve the API.
Open the Frontend: Open the HTML file in a web browser. The map should display the vehicle's current location and route.

## Troubleshooting
__dirname is not defined: Ensure that you are using the updated track.controller.js code with ES module compatibility.
Server Error: Check file paths and ensure the JSON data file is correctly formatted and accessible.
